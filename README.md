Playing around with searching. Currently there is an implementation of [tf-idf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), with both a CLI and a web-server frontend.

Uses the 1987 Reuters data available from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/reuters21578-mld/).

It's obviously very rough right now.
